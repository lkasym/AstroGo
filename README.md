## Overview
AstroGo provides users with customized astrological readings by analyzing planetary positions, houses, and other astrological factors. Users can interact with an AI-powered chatbot trained on a dataset crafted from various astrology sources and fine-tuned using OpenAI’s GPT-4-turbo. The app also integrates with the OpenCage API to provide location-based astrological insights.

## Features
- **Interactive AI Chatbot**: Users can ask questions and receive insights based on astrological interpretations.
- **Personalized Horoscope Analysis**: Custom predictions based on user data.
- **Responsive Frontend**: A clean, intuitive interface built with React Native.
- **Efficient API Backend**: Fast processing with Flask API to handle predictions and data processing.
- **Location-Based Insights**: Uses the OpenCage API to provide location-specific predictions based on user input.

- **Frontend**: React Native
- **Backend**: Flask, Python
- **AI Model**: OpenAI’s GPT-4-turbo, fine-tuned on a custom astrology dataset
- **Location API**: OpenCage API for geolocation-based data

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm for React Native
- Python 3.x
- An OpenAI API key
- An OpenCage API key

### Backend Setup (Flask API)
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the `AstroGo` directory:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd AstroGo/backend
   ```
2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Add your OpenCage API key in the `app.py` file for geolocation functionality.
4. Run the Flask API:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

### Frontend Setup (React Native)
1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   ```
2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the React Native app:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Connecting Backend and Frontend
Ensure that the Flask API is running on a known port (e.g., `http://localhost:5000`). Update the API URL in the frontend code to match the backend endpoint.

## Usage
1. Start the Flask API in the `backend` folder.
2. Launch the React Native app in the `frontend` folder.
3. Interact with the app by inputting birth details, asking astrology-related questions, and viewing personalized readings generated by the AI chatbot.

## Data Sources
The dataset used in this project was curated from various classical astrology texts and online sources:
- Saptarishis Astrology Articles
- Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra
- Phaladeepika (2nd Edition, 1950)

## Model Training
The custom dataset was preprocessed and fine-tuned using OpenAI’s GPT-4-turbo model (`GPT-4o`) to generate highly accurate and relevant astrology predictions.
